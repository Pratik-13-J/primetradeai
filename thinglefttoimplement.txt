limit order is got filled above the price set in the limit

You should say:
A) Some addons improvement in project:

Paginate requests (Binance limit = 1000 candles per request)
Loop using startTime and endTime
Store in database (Postgres / Parquet)
Use async requests for performance
Next step (optional but powerful):

👉 Auto-display balance after each trade
👉 Add PnL summary
👉 Add risk-based position sizing

B) Some add to complete a real trading bot:

Show how to calculate RSI, EMA, VWAP on this data
Show how to stream live BTC price via WebSocket
Show how to backtest on this data
Help integrate this into your trading bot architecture


C) Some additional Q/A for me to know?: 
Show how to use OS environment variables (production style)
Show how to securely deploy on VPS
Show how to structure config for multiple environments (dev/test/prod)
Help you simulate API keys if testnet gives issues
How to paginate 1000+ candles properly
How to fetch entire BTC history efficiently
How to integrate this into your trading bot architecture
How to backtest using this dataframe
Save as Parquet instead of CSV (faster for ML)
How to auto-format to proper OHLCV schema
